            <h1>Recommendation</h1>
            <p>
                There are currently no specific recommendations for parental or peer influence on children/young people’s sports participation or physical activity, although a number of studies have shown a relationship between parent and childhood activity (Trost et al. 2003). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The UK-wide Chief Medical Officers’ guidelines for physical activity for parents/adults, recommend that over a week, activity should add up to <a class="textLink" href="http://www.bhfactive.org.uk/userfiles/Documents/startactivestayactive.pdf" target="_blank">at least 150 minutes (2½ hours) of moderate intensity activity.</a> This should be completed in bouts of 10 minutes or more, or to do 30 minutes on at least 5 days a week.

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Definitions</h1>
            <p>
                The benchmarks used by the Research Work Group to allocate a grade to this indicator were: (1) Percentage of parents who meet the UK Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults. (2) Percentage of family members and peers that take part in sport. (3) Probability of children being ‘hooked on sport’ (percentage of children who take part in sport on three or more occasions a week, in an extracurricular (school-based) or a community club setting) if their parents or peers/friends are also involved in sport.

In this survey, the children reported that 27% of mothers, 36% of fathers, 39% of brothers, 31% of sisters, 35% of other family members and 64% of the children’s friends (peers) took part in sport. The data also showed that <span class="italic bold">18% and 26% of children took part in sport with their mother and father, respectively.</span> 25% of children took part in sport with their brother, 19% with their sister, 20% with other family members, and 68% with their friends (peers).

                        Further analysis of the School Sport Survey (2015) data found there is an increased probability of children being ‘hooked on sport’ (percentage of children who take part in sport on three or more occasions a week, in an extracurricular (school-based) or a community club setting), if their parents or friends are also involved in sport. Results showed a 32% increased chance if their dad, 27% increased chance if their mum, and 23% increased chance if their friends were also involved in sport.

                        Although there was little change in the participation in sport and physical activity levels of adults. The additional evidence demonstrating a parental/peer influence on children’s participation in sport, which was absent in the 2014 Report Card, prompted the Research Work Group to assign a grade of D+ compared to D in the 2014 Report Card.

                            All surveys used self-report methods to obtain data on physical activity and sport participation, therefore only surrogate measures were available.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There are currently no large scale studies in Wales in which physical activity has been measured objectively in Adults.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Since physical inactivity is a problem for children and young people of all ages in Wales (see Overall Physical Activity Levels indicator), interventions could encourage families as a whole to be physically active and reduce sedentary time together.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Future research needs to focus on the influence of parents on various amounts and types of physical activity and how these change with age.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Parents are encouraged to participate in sport, dance and physical activity. Parents should try to reduce their own and their child/children’s sitting time (sedentary time), especially time spent in front of screens.

                        <li>
                            Parents are encouraged to regularly plan for, and engage in physical activity or sports with their children, particularly in the evenings, weekends and holidays. Parents should encourage active transport and allow their children to explore physically active challenges within their environment.
