        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
          Unlike the other indicators there are no purely objective measures
          that can be used to inform the report card. However, we did utilise
          the WHO Europe Health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) policy audit
          tool (PAT). This tool provided an internationally recognised framework
          that offers both credibility and potential continuity if used in
          future. It could also offer potential comparability if adopted across
          other countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In interpreting this indicator we included national policies,
          strategies, action plans, legislation and a few other advisory and
          technical documents that have a direct bearing on children’s physical
          activity, that were still ‘active’. Twenty-one national instruments
          were identified.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h1>Current Survey Data</h1>
        <p>
          Guided by the HEPA PAT tool we considered the evidence relating to key
          policy domains that influence physical activity in children including:
          Health, Education, Sport, Transport, Environment, Design & Planning,
          Play, Sustainable Development, and Cross- cutting (i.e. cut across all
          policy portfolios). Within each of these domains a range of key
          ‘elements’ were identified from the HEPA PAT tool refined by the
          research working group (RWG), that could individually or collectively
          impact on the effectiveness of the policy instrument. These elements
          included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Number & breadth of policies</li>
          <li>Identified supporting actions</li>
          <li>Identified accountable organisation(s)</li>
          <li>Identifiable reporting structures</li>
          <li>Monitoring & Evaluation plans</li>
          <li>Identified funding/ resourcing</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">

          The following policy documents were used in assigning a grade to this
          indicator: Climbing Higher, Creating an Active Wales, the Active
          Travel Act, Sport Wales, Every Child Hooked on Sport, Play Wales, The
          Right to Play, Healthy Schools, Future Generations, the National
          Health Service Together for Health, and the Welsh Government’s Our
          Healthy Future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Local policies were not considered in the grading process due to time
          and resource constraints.

            <p>
              Whilst the HEPA PAT tool was very helpful in analysing this
              indicator it was still a largely subjective process, and so a
              simple scoring system was developed using the ‘elements’ described
              in the tool. Each element was ascribed a percentage score
              ‘weighted’ to reflect the element’s perceived importance in
              translating the policy instruments effectively. So, for example,
              the number of policies was deemed less important than the
              identifiable supporting actions. After initial ‘weighting’ by the
              indicator lead experts, the final weighting was considered,
              refined and agreed by the whole RWG.
            </p>

            <p>The final scoring matrix was as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No. and breadth of relevant policies - 10% (5% No. & 5% Breadth)
              </li>
              <li>Identified supporting actions - 20%</li>
              <li>Identified accountable organisation - 25%</li>
              <li>Identifiable reporting structures - 15%</li>
              <li>
                Identified funding and resources - 20% (5% no. of identified
                national programmes & 15% funding)
              </li>
              <li>Monitoring & Evaluation Plan – 10%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Applying this led to an overall grade of 54% that translates to a
              C+. Since the 2016 AHK- Wales report card, the Government grade
              has decreased slightly from B- to C+. One possible explanation for
              this change may be the use of the HEPA PAT tool in 2018 which made
              the process less subjective.

              Considerations
            </h5>
          </div>
          <div class="expandContent considerations">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Though still in existence and ‘active’, some of the policies are
                now quite old. This is important to take into account because
                some of the original and intended activities, funding mechanisms
                and delivery systems will have changed over time, particularly
                during this period that incorporates the global economic
                downturn that resulted in significant organisational, structural
                and systemic changes. It should also be noted that a new
                curriculum is being developed for settings and schools in Wales.
                Although this proposed curriculum cannot bolster this year’s
                report card grade, it illustrates future governmental
                involvement and institutional commitment to the development of
                relevant polices and strategies to support physical activity
                among the youth population. Fourteen of the twenty-one policies
                have identifiable actions related to physical activity although
                actions specific and relevant to physical activity were limited
                across Welsh policies, as some only allocated one supporting
                action or requirement, and others have identified actions that
                are seemingly too broad.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fourteen of the twenty-one policies identified ‘lead’
                organisations, who support and take responsibility for some of
                the identified physical activity policies and provisions.
                However, although ‘leads’ have been identified there is often no
                reference to accountability for the delivery of specific actions
                in many of the policies. Furthermore, it should be noted that in
                some cases, accountability is limited to Welsh Government
                Ministers or a single agency, which could potentially be seen as
                a problem and reduce overall accountability because often the
                delivery may be dependent on other organisations or individuals
                for whom there is no obvious line of accountability or incentive
                to comply.
              </li>
              <li>
                There were often no apparent chains of command or clear lines of
                authority, communication and duties. However, it seems evident
                that in order to improve the effectiveness of physical activity
                policies and the overall government’s role in implementing them,
                a clear reporting structure ought to be defined.
              </li>
              <li>
                Five of the twenty-one policies articulated an evaluation and
                monitoring plan. Although this number is quite low, relative to
                total number of identified policies, four of the five are
                mainstream policy areas directly affecting physical activity.
                Additionally, it is worth noting that of the various types of
                policy (e.g., legislation, strategy, action plan, guidance) that
                the RWG identified for this indicator, all of the ‘Action Plans’
                outlined monitoring and evaluation strategies. Perhaps this is
                because action plans are time bound and generally tied to
                specific measurable objectives or targets and thus easier to
                evaluate, whereas governmental legislation is on-going and tends
                to remain broad in scope.
              </li>
              <li>
                Five of the twenty-one policies identified specific funding to
                support their identified actions. However, most of these were
                referenced as ‘identifying’ or ‘reviewing’ funding opportunities
                rather than directly providing evidence of already allocated or
                dedicated provisions.
              </li>
              <li>
                As part of the government’s commitment to providing and
                promoting physical activity in Wales, it has supported a number
                of national programmes designed to increase physical activity
                among children and young people. The RWG identified nine of
                these programmes as evidence of national “resources” geared
                towards increasing physical activity (PA) outcomes, whereby each
                programme can be seen as a PA opportunity for children, or a
                promotional initiative to encourage future PA among this
                population.
