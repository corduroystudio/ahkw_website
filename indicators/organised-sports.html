            <p>
                There are currently no specific recommendations for the amount of children and young people’s sport or dance participation. However, in line with Sport Wales’ Vision of ‘Every Child Hooked on Sport for Life’, the percentage of children ‘hooked on sport’ was used by the Research Work Group as the benchmark for grading this indicator.

The survey showed that 48% of children were ‘hooked on sport’ (children who take part in sport on three or more occasions a week in an extracurricular or community club setting). These data showed an upward trend in the percentage of children ‘hooked on sport’ from 27, 40, and 48 percent in 2011, 2013 and 2015, respectively. Moreover, similar proportions of primary (49%) and secondary (48%) age school children were ‘hooked on sport’, although more boys (52%) were ‘hooked on sport’ than girls (44%). Even though there were differences by age, ethnicity, disability and socioeconomic status, there has been an <span class="italic bold">overall increase in the proportion of children ‘hooked on sport’</span> between 2013 and 2015 for both boys and girls across all of these subgroups (age, ethnicity, disability and socioeconomic status).

                        <span class="underline">The Further Education Sport Survey (2015)</span> collected data on 4,568 students aged 16+ years old from 12 FE colleges across Wales. The survey showed that <span class="italic bold">49% of students were ‘hooked on sport’</span> (take part in sport on three or more occasions a week, in any setting). Specifically in the younger students aged 16-19 years old, 52% of these students were ‘hooked on sport’. The findings in relation to subgroups (gender, age, ethnicity, disability and socioeconomic status) in this survey were very similar to findings from the School Sport Survey (2015). However, trends could not be established due to the survey data being in the first year of data collection.

                        The Research Working Group concluded that the increase in the proportion of children ‘hooked on sport’, and the finding that at least 40% of children in each subgroup (gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and disability) were ‘hooked on sport’, was sufficient to warrant an increase in the grade from a C- in 2014 to a C in the 2016 Report Card.

                            School Sport Survey and the Further Education Sport Survey both used self-report methods, although, a major strength of the School Sport Survey is its reach coverage, with the 2015 survey being the largest to date and the largest survey of its kind in the UK. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Both surveys do not capture the duration of the sport sessions that children and young people take part in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Although there is a lack of evidence on children of early years (under 5 years old), there is strong evidence on all ages of children and young people from  7 years old to 19+ years old. This was not available in the previous Report Card.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The best available evidence shows that there has been an increase in children and young people being ‘hooked on sport’. However, a significant effort by all still needs to be made to increase the proportion of ‘hooked on sport’.  As well as, to achieve Sport Wales’ target of “75% of children and young people ‘hooked on sport’ by 2026”.
