            <p>
                Since children and young people spend a large amount of time in their day at school. The school environment represents many opportunities for the promotion and facilitation of physical activity (e.g. PE, extracurricular sports).

            <p>
                The benchmarks for this indicator relate to physical activity opportunities at school and physical education. The Research Work Group used data on, (1) the percentage of schools that offer physical activity opportunities (excluding PE) to the majority of their pupils; (2) the percentage of schools with sufficient facilities/equipment to support pupils’ physical activity and sport; (3) the percentage of schools where teachers were confident in delivering quality PE lessons; (4) the percentage of children that believe PE lessons and school sport help them to have a healthy lifestyle; to allocate a grade to this indicator.

                            The School Sport Survey uses self-report methods to obtain data, and therefore may result in some biases.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There was insufficient information on the time allocated by primary and secondary schools for Physical Education. This has been used as a benchmark for other countries in the Active Healthy Kids Global Alliance in past report cards. Currently, children/young people should achieve 120 (2 hours) minutes of Physical Education on average per week (UK).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While there is information on the amount of extracurricular activities being offered at school, we do not know about the quality of those opportunities. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Further research is also needed on factors that influence participation in physical activity at school.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Over the past 10 years, a significant effort has been made in Wales to influence children’s physical activity and sport participation through programmes such as “Dragon Multi-Skills and Sport” for primary, and “5x60” programmes for secondary age children. These programmes have been developed, implemented and evaluated and found evidence that children’s extracurricular participation had increased and the range of activities that schools offered had broadened. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sport Wales in collaboration with Public Health Wales and the education sector have influenced Government to give physical literacy the same emphasis in the school curriculum as literacy and numeracy.

                        <li>
                            Schools should maximise opportunities for pupils to move more and sit less throughout the school day.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Schools should continue to provide opportunities for pupils’ involvement in sports and physical activities.
